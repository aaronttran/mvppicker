PROJECT DESCRIPTION
For my project, I will be making a “this or that” type of game that guides the user to pick
who they think is the best player in the NBA this 2021-2022 season. The additional library I will
be using from the p5.js site list is the p5.clickable library. The artistic gesture of the piece is to
visualize the user’s thought process of who they think the best player in the NBA is. The issue I
am trying to convey is for the user to see if they agree or disagree with the NBA’s pick for the
MVP (Most Valuable Player) award this season. My game/tool will first start out with a “Pick a
starting player,” and the game will continue by comparing other players with that starting player. The 
visual aspect of the game will be a simple and NBA-themed side-by-side comparison that will utilize a good amount of pictures and
maybe videos. The home screen will consist of a big title that reads “Who Is Your MVP This
Year?” Underneath the title will be pictures of all the MVP candidates this season and a start
button. The main activity screen will begin with the Starting Player Selector, then it will continue
with the next player comparison. The end screen will display “Your 2021-2022 MVP is
Selected Player.” The candidate list will consist of about six players who have been
performing the best so far this season. The Starting Player Selector will either list two or
three players who are at the bottom of the candidate list.
